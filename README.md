# ods_nlp_final_project
This is a final project for ods NLP course. Here I try to fine-tune Bert using Lora to build a reward model. A detailed desciption is avaliable at [PDF](https://github.com/SergeyIsh/ods_nlp_final_project/blob/main/ODS_final_project.pdf). A model is avaliable [here](https://github.com/SergeyIsh/ods_nlp_final_project/blob/main/model.ipynb).
